    "\"Hello World\" is a classic programming exercise, often considered the first step in learning a new programming language. It consists of constructing a minimal program which will output the words \"Hello World.\" If it runs without errors, this demonstrates that the software is installed correctly in the computing environment and that the user has been able to build a very simple program.\n",
